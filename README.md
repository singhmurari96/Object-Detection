In this project, we will learn to:

Import datasets from Keras
Use one-hot vectors for categorical labels
Addlayers to a Keras model
Load pre-trained weights
Make predictions using a trained Keras model
The dataset we will be using is the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.
